Classification is a technique classifying data into a given number of categories. In Machine Learning, most classification methods such as logistic regression, support vector machines, and random forest are applied to data with similar sample sizes for target variable. However, we will also encounter many data with different sample sizes for target variable. In the face of such unbalanced data, how to deal with it and how to predict the response variables with high precision by using classification method has aroused our deep concern. When dealing with unbalanced data, one of the most commonly used techniques is resampling, which includes two main types, undersampling and oversampling. Usually, people use undersampling when dealing with large datasets and oversampling when dealing with small datasets to get balance. As for our data, we speculate that the random undersampling method might work better because it has a huge amount of observations.
